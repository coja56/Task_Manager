Task_ manager _functions.py

The code is in **Python** using fuctions to improve the modularity of the code in **Task_Manager** as we assign tasks to users and passwords.

1. The program should include at least the following functions

    * reg_user — that is called when the user selects ‘ r ’ to register a user
    * add_task — that is called when a user selects ‘ a ’ to add a new task.
    * view_all — that is called when users type ‘va’ to view all the tasks listed in ‘tasks.txt’.
    * view_mine — that is called when users type ‘vm’ to view all the tasks that have been assigned to them.
    
    
2. The application generates reports to the main menu  .The menu for the admin user should now look something like this:


        Please select one of the following options:
        r - register user
        a - add task
        va - view all task
        vm - view my task
        gr - generate reports
        ds - display statistics
        e - exit
        
        
 3. The program generates two text files for reports on tasks and user overview:
 * **Task_overview.txt** should contain:
    * The total number of task that have been generated and tracked using the application **Task Manager**
    * The total number of completed tasks
    * The total number of uncompleted tasks
    * The total number of tasks that are overdue
    * What percentage of tasks assigned to the user that are incomplete
    * What percentage of the tasks assigned to the user that are overdue
    
* **User_overview.txt** should contain
   * The total number of users registered on the application **Task Manager**
   * The total number of tasks that have been generated and tracked using ** Task Manager**
   * For each user also describe:
      * The total number of tasks assignned to that user
      * What percentage of the total tasks have been assigned to the user?
      * What percentage of the tasks assigned to the user have been completed?
      * What percentage of the tasks assigned to the user must still be completed?
      * What percentage of the tasks assigned to that user have not been completed and are overdue?
